# Mars-Scraping

In this challenge, I created a notebook that scrapes a website for data. The website contains data on the planet mars, which I then analyzed and converted to a pandas data frame, I then created a few graphs to go along with my analysis.

### What I Did:

	1. Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles
	2. Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
	3. Find the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
	4. Find the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
	5. Plot how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
	6. Visually estimate the results by plotting the daily minimum temperature.

## Thoughts:

This challenge took me much longer than I would like to admit. HTML and webscraping is challenging trying to dig through the website to find the right elements to pull from, and in the end it became a lot more of a trial and error situation. Despite the lenght of time it took for me to get through this basic code, I can see the value in what web scraping can do. With the advent of AI becoming more prominent in the news, I can only imagine that high levels of data scraping are involved to gather the data that is necessary. This really ignited my excitement for HTML, and I'm excited to continue this journey!
